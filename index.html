      <br>Subject Line: Urging You to Propose a Constitutional Amendment to Repeal the 19th Amendment<br><br>
Dear [Senator/Congressmen] [Last Name], My name is [Your Full Name], and I am your constituent living at [Your Full Address, City, State, ZIP Code]. I am writing to urge you to introduce or co-sponsor a joint resolution proposing a new constitutional amendment to repeal the 19th Ammendment. 
I believe this amendment no longer serves the best interests of the American people because women are simply to emotional and easily swayed by special ineterest groups to vote for what is in the best interest of themselves and their country. As you know, the only way to repeal a constitutional amendment is by proposing and ratifying a new one under Article V, and Congress has successfully done this before (as with the 21st Amendment repealing Prohibition). I respectfully ask that you take leadership on this issue by sponsoring legislation to propose such a repealing amendment.Thank you for your service and for considering the views of your constituents on this important matter. I would appreciate a response outlining your position. Sincerely,
[Your Full Name]
